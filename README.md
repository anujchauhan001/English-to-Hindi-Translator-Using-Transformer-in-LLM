## English-to-Hindi-Translator-Using-Transformer-in-LLM
Project Overview
This project demonstrates the development of an English to Hindi translator using the Transformer model, a deep learning architecture that has revolutionized Natural Language Processing (NLP). The Transformer model is used to perform machine translation, taking an English sentence as input and providing the corresponding translation in Hindi. This solution leverages state-of-the-art techniques in machine translation, sequence-to-sequence models, and large language models (LLMs).

The model uses the Transformer’s self-attention mechanism to learn the relationships between words in sentences, allowing it to translate more accurately compared to traditional methods.

Key Features
English to Hindi Translation: The model translates input text in English to its equivalent in Hindi.
Transformer Architecture: Utilizes the Transformer model, which is known for its efficiency in handling sequence-to-sequence tasks like machine translation.
Real-time Translation: Designed to provide translations in real-time for any given input text.
Preprocessing Pipeline: Implements tokenization, padding, and embedding techniques to prepare data for model training.
Technologies Used
Python: The primary programming language for model development.
TensorFlow & Keras: Deep learning libraries used to implement the Transformer model.
Natural Language Processing (NLP): Libraries such as NLTK and spaCy are used for text preprocessing and tokenization.
Hadoop: Used for distributed data processing in handling large text corpora for training the translation model. The large datasets of parallel corpora (English-Hindi) are processed efficiently using Hadoop’s distributed computing capabilities.
Docker: Docker is used to containerize the project for easy deployment. The container ensures consistency across different development environments, making it easier to run the application without worrying about environment mismatches.
